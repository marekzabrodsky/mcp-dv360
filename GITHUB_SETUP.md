# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 📋 Manual GitHub Repository Creation

Since GitHub CLI is not available, follow these steps to create the repository manually:

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+" button** in the top right
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name:** `dv360-mcp-server`
   - **Description:** `AI-powered DV360 campaign management through Model Context Protocol`
   - **Visibility:** Public ✅
   - **Initialize:** Leave unchecked (we already have files)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/marekzabrodsky/mcp-dv360.git

# Verify the remote
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Upload

Check that these files are visible on GitHub:
- ✅ `README.md` with badges and features
- ✅ `INSTALL.md` with installation guide
- ✅ `src/` directory with MCP server code
- ✅ `requirements.txt` with dependencies
- ✅ All test files (without sensitive data)

### 4. Update Repository Settings

In your GitHub repository settings:

1. **Add topics:** `mcp`, `dv360`, `google-ads`, `ai`, `claude`, `advertising`
2. **Set website:** Add documentation link if desired
3. **Enable Issues:** For community support
4. **Add description:** Ensure it matches the README

### 5. Update Documentation

After the repository is live, update these references:

**In README.md:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marekzabrodsky/mcp-dv360.git
```

**In INSTALL.md:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marekzabrodsky/mcp-dv360.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.
